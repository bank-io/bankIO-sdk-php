## createConsent

> \BankIO\Sdk\Model\ConsentsResponse201 createConsent($organisation, $x_request_id, $tpp_psu_id, $psu_ip_address, $digest, $signature, $tpp_signature_certificate, $psu_id, $psu_id_type, $psu_corporate_id, $psu_corporate_id_type, $tpp_redirect_preferred, $tpp_redirect_uri, $tpp_nok_redirect_uri, $tpp_explicit_authorisation_preferred, $tpp_brand_logging_information, $tpp_notification_uri, $tpp_notification_content_preferred, $psu_ip_port, $psu_accept, $psu_accept_charset, $psu_accept_encoding, $psu_accept_language, $psu_user_agent, $psu_http_method, $psu_device_id, $psu_geo_location, $consents)

Create consent

This method create a consent resource, defining access rights to dedicated accounts of  a given PSU-ID. These accounts are addressed explicitly in the method as  parameters as a core function.  **Side Effects** When this consent request is a request where the \"recurringIndicator\" equals \"true\", and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information  for the addressed PSU, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new  consent request is authorised by the PSU.  Optional Extension: As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all PSD2 related services for all available accounts.  As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account.  The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP.  This option is not supported for the Embedded SCA Approach.  As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights   * to see the list of available payment accounts or   * to see the list of available payment accounts with balances.

It might be contained even if an OAuth2 based authentication was performed in a pre-step or an OAuth2 based SCA was performed in an preceding AIS service in the same session. In this case the ASPSP might check whether PSU-ID and token match,  according to ASPSP documentation.

This preference might be ignored by the ASPSP, if a signing basket is not supported as functionality.  If it equals \"false\" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.

LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.

## getAccountList

> \BankIO\Sdk\Model\AccountList getAccountList($organisation, $x_request_id, $consent_id, $with_balance, $digest, $signature, $tpp_signature_certificate, $psu_ip_address, $psu_ip_port, $psu_accept, $psu_accept_charset, $psu_accept_encoding, $psu_accept_language, $psu_user_agent, $psu_http_method, $psu_device_id, $psu_geo_location)

Read account list

Read the identifiers of the available payment account together with  booking balance information, depending on the consent granted.  It is assumed that a consent of the PSU to this access is already given and stored on the ASPSP system.  The addressed list of accounts depends then on the PSU ID and the stored consent addressed by consentId,  respectively the OAuth2 access token.   Returns all identifiers of the accounts, to which an account access has been granted to through  the /consents endpoint by the PSU.  In addition, relevant information about the accounts and hyperlinks to corresponding account  information resources are provided if a related consent has been already granted.  Remark: Note that the /consents endpoint optionally offers to grant an access on all available  payment accounts of a PSU.  In this case, this endpoint will deliver the information about all available payment accounts  of the PSU at this ASPSP.

## getCardAccountBalances

> \BankIO\Sdk\Model\ReadCardAccountBalanceResponse200 getCardAccountBalances($organisation, $account_id, $x_request_id, $consent_id, $digest, $signature, $tpp_signature_certificate, $psu_ip_address, $psu_ip_port, $psu_accept, $psu_accept_charset, $psu_accept_encoding, $psu_accept_language, $psu_user_agent, $psu_http_method, $psu_device_id, $psu_geo_location)

Read card account balances

Reads balance data from a given card account addressed by  \"account-id\".   Remark: This account-id can be a tokenised identification due  to data protection reason since the path information might be  logged on intermediary servers within the ASPSP sphere.  This account-id then can be retrieved by the  \"Get card account list\" call.

## startConsentAuthorisation

> \BankIO\Sdk\Model\StartScaprocessResponse startConsentAuthorisation($organisation, $consent_id, $x_request_id, $digest, $signature, $tpp_signature_certificate, $psu_id, $psu_id_type, $psu_corporate_id, $psu_corporate_id_type, $tpp_redirect_preferred, $tpp_redirect_uri, $tpp_nok_redirect_uri, $tpp_notification_uri, $tpp_notification_content_preferred, $psu_ip_address, $psu_ip_port, $psu_accept, $psu_accept_charset, $psu_accept_encoding, $psu_accept_language, $psu_user_agent, $psu_http_method, $psu_device_id, $psu_geo_location, $unknown_base_type)

Start the authorisation process for a consent

Create an authorisation sub-resource and start the authorisation process of a consent.  The message might in addition transmit authentication and authorisation related data.  his method is iterated n times for a n times SCA authorisation in a  corporate context, each creating an own authorisation sub-endpoint for  the corresponding PSU authorising the consent.  The ASPSP might make the usage of this access method unnecessary,  since the related authorisation resource will be automatically created by  the ASPSP after the submission of the consent data with the first POST consents call.  The start authorisation process is a process which is needed for creating a new authorisation  or cancellation sub-resource.   This applies in the following scenarios:    * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding Payment      initiation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be      uploaded by using the extended forms:     * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentfication',      * 'startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication'      * 'startAuthorisationWithEncryptedPsuAuthentication'     * 'startAuthorisationWithAuthentciationMethodSelection'    * The related payment initiation cannot yet be executed since a multilevel SCA is mandated.   * The ASPSP has indicated with an 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink in the preceding      payment cancellation response that an explicit start of the authorisation process is needed by the TPP.      The 'startAuthorisation' hyperlink can transport more information about data which needs to be uploaded      by using the extended forms as indicated above.   * The related payment cancellation request cannot be applied yet since a multilevel SCA is mandate for      executing the cancellation.   * The signing basket needs to be authorised yet.

Update PSU Data for consents

This method update PSU data on the consents  resource if needed.  It may authorise a consent within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.  Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of  the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.  This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible update PSU data requests in the context of a consent request if needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU data request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific update PSU data request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the payment initiation request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU data request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible update PSU data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.  There are the following request types on this access path:   * Update PSU identification   * Update PSU authentication   * Select PSU autorization method      WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.      Maybe in a later version the access path will change.   * Transaction Authorisation     WARNING: This method needs a reduced header,      therefore many optional elements are not present.      Maybe in a later version the access path will change.
